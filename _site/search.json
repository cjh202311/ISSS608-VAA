    "text": "3 Grammar of Graphics\nBefore we getting started using ggplot2, it is important for us to understand the principles of Grammer of Graphics.\nGrammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n3.1 A Layered Grammar of Graphics\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. Figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2.\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background."

In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n5.2 Combining two ggplot2 graphs\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Combining three ggplot2 graphs\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“|” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“/” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\n\nCode\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about, refer to Plot Assembly.\n\n\n5.4 Creating a composite figure with tag\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\n\nCode\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Creating figure with insert\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6 Creating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggtheme\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()"

have a slight edge in math scores.\nReading: Females have a slight advantage in reading scores compared to males, with males having a slightly lower distribution of scores.\nScience: The distribution of science scores is similar for males and females, but males tend to have slightly higher scores.\nTotal Score: The overall performance distribution in total scores is similar for males and females, with no significant gender differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Student Performance by School\nThe following code calculates the maths, reading, and science, as well as the average grades in these three

average scores across schools is very wide, with the top performing schools able to have an average score of about 800 per subject. However, schools at the bottom end of the scale have less than 300, and even less than 200 in reading.\nStudents from two schools, 70201256 and 70201120, had top average performance in two of the three subjects and top average scores per subject.\nStudents from two schools, 70205525 and 70202489, performed poorly.\nSome schools had students who were at the top in individual subjects but did not rank very high in the overall rankings, suggesting that these schools were better educated in certain individual subjects, e.g., 70205185 in reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Student Performance by Musical Instruments\nThe following code shows scatter plots of students’ maths, reading, science and overall performance against the number of musical instruments owned, as well as showing the relationship by fitting a line through linear regression.\n\n\nCode\nplot_math &lt;- ggplot(data=PV, aes(x=mi_num, y=Math_Score)) +\n  geom_point(color=\"#3459e6\") +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, size=0.5,color = \"#FF5733\") +\n  labs(title =\"Math Score by Musical instruments\", x = \"\", y = \"\")+\n    theme_minimal() +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 8),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\nplot_reading &lt;- ggplot(data=PV, aes(x=mi_num, y=Reading_Score)) +\n  geom_point(color=\"#3459e6\") +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, size=0.5,color = \"#FF5733\") +\n  labs(title =\"Reading Score by Musical instruments\", x = \"\", y = \"\")+\n    theme_minimal() +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 8),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\nplot_science &lt;- ggplot(data=PV, aes(x=mi_num, y=Science_Score)) +\n  geom_point(color=\"#3459e6\") +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, size=0.5,color = \"#FF5733\") +\n  labs(title =\"Science Score by Musical instruments\", x = \"\", y = \"\")+\n    theme_minimal() +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 8),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\nplot_total &lt;- ggplot(data=PV, aes(x=mi_num, y=Total_Score)) +\n  geom_point(color=\"#3459e6\") +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, size=0.5,color = \"#FF5733\") +\n  labs(title =\"Total Score by Musical instruments\", x = \"\", y = \"\")+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 8),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\ncombined_plot &lt;- plot_math + plot_reading + plot_science + plot_total\ncombined_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights from Visualisations\n\n\n\nAs can be seen by the graph, the linear regression fit line is slightly upward, suggesting that students with more musical equipment in this dataset are likely to trend better in maths, reading, science, and overall performance in general.\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Student Performance by Own room\nThe following code plots box-and-line graphs to compare student performance in maths, reading, science and overall scores by whether or not they had the room to themselves.\n\n\nCode\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data = PV, aes(x =Math_Score , y = Own_Room)) +\n        geom_boxplot(fill = \"#3459e6\") +\n        labs(title =\"Math Score by Private Space\",x = \"\", y = \"\")+\n        theme_minimal() +\n        theme(text = element_text(size = 8),\n              plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data = PV, aes(x =Reading_Score , y = Own_Room)) +\n        geom_boxplot( fill = \"#3459e6\") +\n     \n        labs(title =\"Reading Score by Private Space\", x = \"\", y = \"\")+\n        theme_minimal() +\n        theme(text = element_text(size = 8),\n              plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n  \np3 &lt;- ggplot(data = PV, aes(x = Science_Score , y = Own_Room)) +\n        geom_boxplot( fill = \"#3459e6\") +\n       \n        labs(title =\"Science Score by Private Space\", x = \"\", y = \"\")+\n        theme_minimal() +\n        theme(text = element_text(size = 8),\n              plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))  \n\np4 &lt;- ggplot(data = PV, aes(x = Total_Score , y = Own_Room)) +\n        geom_boxplot( fill = \"#3459e6\") +\n       \n        labs(title =\"Total Score by Private Space\", x = \"\", y = \"\")+\n        theme_minimal() +\n        theme(text = element_text(size = 8),\n              plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\ncombined_plot&lt;- p1 + p2 + p3 + p4\ncombined_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights from Visualisations\n\n\n\nFrom the box plot above, it is clear that students with their own rooms generally outperform students without their own rooms in maths, reading, science, and overall scores. This may be because a quiet, distraction-free environment helps students focus better on their studies, which in turn improves their academic performance."

    "text": "5 Conclusion\n\nThe distribution of students’ performance across subjects is right-skewed , indicating that the majority of students tend to have scores clustered towards the higher end of the scale, with a tail extending towards the lower scores.\nGender differences were observed, with males slightly excelling in mathematics, while females performed better in reading.\nSchool-level analysis showcased a wide performance variation, with some excelling in specific subjects.\nSocioeconomic factors like musical instruments and private spaces influenced scores positively. Students with more instruments tended to perform better, and those with private rooms consistently outperformed peers without."

    "text": "6 Limitations\nHowever, it is essential to acknowledge certain limitations in our analysis. The exploration primarily relied on visualizations and graphical representations to uncover patterns and insights. While these visualizations offer a comprehensive overview of the data, they lack the precision and depth that statistical analysis methods could provide. For example, a linear regression fitting a line between the number of musical instruments owned and performance on maths, reading, science and overall grades would only provide a general trend in the relationship and would not establish causality. This trend is a preliminary observation, after which further exploration of the relationship between musical equipment and academic performance may require more in-depth statistical analyses that take into account additional variables and possible interactions."

    "section": "3 Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot",
    "text": "3 Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n3.1 Plotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#3459e6\"), color = \"blue\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I did\n\n\n\nI adjusted the colors to a blue shade, set the line color to “blue,” and chose a minimal theme (theme_minimal()) for a different visual style compared to the provided version.\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Varying fill colors along the x axis\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient().

    "section": "4 Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot",
    "text": "4 Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot\nRaincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n4.1 Plotting a Half Eye graph\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA,\n               fill = \"#3459e6\")+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Adding the boxplot with geom_boxplot()\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA,\n               fill = \"#3459e6\") +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA,\n               fill = \"skyblue\")+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Adding the Dot Plots with stat_dots()\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA,\n               fill = \"#3459e6\") +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA,\n               fill = \"skyblue\")+\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2,\n            color = \"blue\")+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Finishing touch\nLastly, coord_flip() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.theme_economist()\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA,\n               fill = \"#3459e6\") +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA,\n               fill = \"skyblue\")+\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5,\n            color = \"blue\")+\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I did\n\n\n\nI adjusted the colors by using various shades of blue (#3459e6, “skyblue”, and “blue”) for different elements. Additionally, you changed the theme from theme_economist() to theme_minimal(). Furthermore, I increased the width and height of the plot for better visualization ({r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8})."

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\n2.5 How to interpret Bayes Factor\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.

    "text": "3 Visualising Uncertainty: ggdist package\n\nggdist is an R package that provides a flexible set of ggplot2 geoms and stats designed especially for visualising distributions and uncertainty.\nIt is designed for both frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty visualization, taking the view that uncertainty visualization can be unified through the perspective of distribution visualization:\n\nfor frequentist models, one visualises confidence distributions or bootstrap distributions (see vignette(“freq-uncertainty-vis”));\nfor Bayesian models, one visualises probability distributions (see the tidybayes package, which builds on top of ggdist).\n\n\n\n\n3.1 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggdist methods\nIn the code chunk below, stat_pointinterval() of ggdist is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.\n\n\nCode\nexam %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, \n             y = MATHS) ) +\n  stat_pointinterval(color = \"#3459e6\",point_color = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score\",\n    subtitle = \"Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot\")+theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis function comes with many arguments, students are advised to read the syntax reference for more detail.\n\n\nFor example, in the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\n.width = 0.95\n.point = median\n.interval = qi\n\n\n\nCode\nexam %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_pointinterval(.width = 0.95,\n  .point = median,\n  .interval = qi,color = \"#3459e6\",point_color = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising confidence intervals of median math score\",\n    subtitle = \"Median Point + Multiple-interval plot\")+theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I learnt…\n\n\n\n\n.width: It controls the width of the confidence interval. It specifies the size of the confidence interval, usually a decimal between 0 and 1. For example, .width = 0.95 indicates a confidence interval width of 95%, a common choice.\n.point: It determines the statistic used to represent the central point. It can be a string specifying the statistic to use, such as \"mean\", \"median\", and so on. In the example, .point = \"median\" means that the median will be used to represent the central point.\n.interval: It defines the method used to calculate the confidence interval. It can be a string indicating the calculation method, such as \"qi\" (quantile-based interval), \"ci\" (confidence interval), etc. In the example, .interval = \"qi\" means using quantiles to calculate the confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggdist methods\n\n\nCode\nexam %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_pointinterval(.width = 0.99,\n  .point = median,\n  .interval = qi,color = \"#3459e6\",point_color = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising confidence intervals of median math score (99% confidence intervals)\",\n    subtitle = \"Median Point + Multiple-interval plot\")+theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggdist methods\nIn the code chunk below, stat_gradientinterval() of ggdist is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.\n\n\nCode\nexam %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, \n             y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_gradientinterval(  fill = \"skyblue\", \n    color = \"#3459e6\",   point_color = \"red\", \n    show.legend = TRUE     \n  ) +                        \n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score\",\n    subtitle = \"Gradient + interval plot\")+\n  theme_minimal()"

    "text": "5 Funnel Plot for Fair Visual Comparison: ggplot2 methods\nIn this section, you will gain hands-on experience on building funnel plots step-by-step by using ggplot2. It aims to enhance you working experience of ggplot2 to customise speciallised data visualisation like funnel plot.\n\n5.1 Computing the basic derived fields\nTo plot the funnel plot from scratch, we need to derive cumulative death rate and standard error of cumulative death rate.\n\n\nCode\ndf &lt;- covid19 %&gt;%\n  mutate(rate = Death / Positive) %&gt;%\n  mutate(rate.se = sqrt((rate*(1-rate)) / (Positive))) %&gt;%\n  filter(rate &gt; 0)\n\n\nNext, the fit.mean is computed by using the code chunk below.\n\n\nCode\nfit.mean &lt;- weighted.mean(df$rate, 1/df$rate.se^2)\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Calculate lower and upper limits for 95% and 99.9% CI\nThe code chunk below is used to compute the lower and upper limits for 95% confidence interval.\n\n\nCode\nnumber.seq &lt;- seq(1, max(df$Positive), 1)\nnumber.ll95 &lt;- fit.mean - 1.96 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) \nnumber.ul95 &lt;- fit.mean + 1.96 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) \nnumber.ll999 &lt;- fit.mean - 3.29 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) \nnumber.ul999 &lt;- fit.mean + 3.29 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) \ndfCI &lt;- data.frame(number.ll95, number.ul95, number.ll999, \n                   number.ul999, number.seq, fit.mean)\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Plotting a static funnel plot\nIn the code chunk below, ggplot2 functions are used to plot a static funnel plot.\n\n\nCode\np &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = Positive, y = rate)) +\n  geom_point(aes(label=`Sub-district`), \n             alpha=0.4, color= \"#3459e6\") +\n  geom_line(data = dfCI, \n            aes(x = number.seq, \n                y = number.ll95), \n            size = 0.4, \n            colour = \"grey40\", \n            linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data = dfCI, \n            aes(x = number.seq, \n                y = number.ul95), \n            size = 0.4, \n            colour = \"grey40\", \n            linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data = dfCI, \n            aes(x = number.seq, \n                y = number.ll999), \n            size = 0.4, \n            colour = \"grey40\") +\n  geom_line(data = dfCI, \n            aes(x = number.seq, \n                y = number.ul999), \n            size = 0.4, \n            colour = \"grey40\") +\n  geom_hline(data = dfCI, \n             aes(yintercept = fit.mean), \n             size = 0.4, \n             colour = \"grey40\") +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,0.05)) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1, y = -0.13, label = \"95%\", size = 3, colour = \"grey40\") + \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 4.5, y = -0.18, label = \"99%\", size = 3, colour = \"grey40\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Cumulative Fatality Rate by Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Cases\") +\n  xlab(\"Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Cases\") + \n  ylab(\"Cumulative Fatality Rate\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12),\n        legend.position = c(0.91,0.85), \n        legend.title = element_text(size=7),\n        legend.text = element_text(size=7),\n        legend.background = element_rect(colour = \"grey60\", linetype = \"dotted\"),\n        legend.key.height = unit(0.3, \"cm\"))+\n  theme_minimal()\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Interactive Funnel Plot: plotly + ggplot2\nThe funnel plot created using ggplot2 functions can be made interactive with ggplotly() of plotly r package.\n\n\nCode\nfp_ggplotly &lt;- ggplotly(p,\n  tooltip = c(\"label\", \n              \"x\", \n              \"y\"))\nfp_ggplotly"
